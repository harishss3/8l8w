## A quick python reference <br>
1. For string manipulation and parsing, there are a number of string methods provided in the standard library. 
Additionally, we can use the re library for more powerful and convinient methods.
    - A list of string methods can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
    - The documentation for the re library  can br found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).
    - [String slicing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-slicing-in-python/) is also a useful tool.
    - The in operator is used to check if a substring is part of a string.
    - The [format operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting) can be used for printf style printing.
