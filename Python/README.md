# Tasks
1. To build a command line interface in python <br>
   The argparse library is very convinient to write user friendly CLIs in Python. Some resources:<br>
   Tutorial 1 - https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/<br>
   Tutorial 2 - https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html  (Both of them are good and cover nearly the same content)<br>
   In-Depth Documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html </br></br>
2. A good first course on Python by Prof. Charles Severance : https://www.py4e.com/  (Though it is Informatics oriented, I found it to be good for a beginner.) 
3. Official Python Documentation : https://docs.python.org/3/  (A life saver)
